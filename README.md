# KJAM OurAus Prototype

Requires Angular and Node.js

https://angular.io/guide/quickstart

To run, navigate to the 'OurAus' folder and run:

```
ng s -o
```

The same command can be executed within the 'University' folder to run the fake-university website.

This will open the website in your default browser, via localhost:4200

In order to create a new user/log in, the server must be running. To do this, navigate to 'OurAus/backend', and run:

```
node server.js
```
